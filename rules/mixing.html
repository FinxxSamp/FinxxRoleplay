                        It means everything that is in our character.
                        Example :

                        - Vehicle

                        What this means is that you are using OOC advice/information for IC purposes
                        Example :
                        You use /pm to ask for a location. /pm is OOC in nature.

                    <div class="text">

                        What this means is that you do impossible things that you would never be able to do in real life
                        but can be done in the game.
                        Example :
                        You are doing Roleplay taking RPG from your trouser pocket.

                    <div class="text">
                        This means that you crash your vehicle into someone without reason or intend to trolling

                    <div class="text">

                        This means you throw / escape into the water and dive to avoid being shot / shootout

                    <div class="text">
                        This means that you refuse someone's roleplay.
                        Example :
                        You guys are fishing, then someone comes and RP hits you.
                        but you guys didn't reply to the RP's at all.

                    <div class="text">

                        This means that you escape from a roleplay situation using /q
                        Example :
                        Always being chased by the police /q
                    </div>

                    <div class="text">

                        That means you're slowing down the roleplay.
                        Example :
                        Some of your rp opponents wrote " /do Conditions "
                        but you are deliberately taking too long.
